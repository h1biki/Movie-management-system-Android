# Movie-management-system-Android

The project (server-side and client-side) aim towards building a mobile and distributed, personalised diary application for keeping track of movies you watched and their details. The mobile app will be a movie memoir that allows people to create, delete, add or view a collection of memories that you had about the movies.
